![CodeBot from Parallel Agile - documentation](images/Parallel-Agile-CodeBot.png "CodeBot from Parallel Agile - documentation")

Welcome to the documentation area for CodeBot from [Parallel Agile](http://www.parallelagile.com) (PA).

This documentation site is organised into the following sections:

* [Articles](articles/) - miscellaneous, useful articles about Parallel Agile and CodeBot
* [CodeBot process guide](codegen-process-guide/) - in-depth tutorial
* [CodeBot reference](codebot-reference/) - just the details
* [Parallel Agile process guide](parallel-agile-process-guide) - an overview of this agile development process

**[CodeBot](https://parallelagile.net/)** is a cloud-based domain-driven, low-code, full-stack application generator. Feed it a domain model from a modeling tool such as Sparx Enterprise Architect, and CodeBot will create a scalable, secure REST API, along with a MongoDB database schema and a Java client library.

If you feed it a set of UX wireframes as well, CodeBot will also create a complete, fully functioning React web-app, already integrated with the generated REST API.

CodeBot is designed to work with distributed teams, especially if they're using the Parallel Agile (PA) development process. PA emphasises up-front collaborative domain modeling and early prototyping - where the prototypes are generated by CodeBot using the collaborative domain model.
