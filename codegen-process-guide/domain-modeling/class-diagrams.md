# Domain Model Class Diagrams

CodeBot reads domain models from UML class diagrams. We recommend using Enterprise Architect from Sparx Systems to create and maintain the diagrams.

The diagrams can be quite complex; CodeBot will read the details it needs to generate the code, tests, documentation etc.

Our example LBA project contains various domain classes, linked together with various relationships - aggregation, composition, association, inheritance etc. 

Here's the complete LBA domain model diagram (right-click and choose View Image to see it at full size):
