# CodeBot - Low-Code Capabilities

This section explores some of the extensibility that makes CodeBot a truly low-code platform. This includes writing domain-driven code (event handlers etc) to define executable business rules as a core part of the domain model.

The section following this then takes "low-code" a step further and covers [how to integrate with other systems](../system-integration/) - third-party REST APIs, microservices etc.
