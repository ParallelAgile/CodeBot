# Example Project - LBA

Throughout this guide, we'll use an example project, LBA, which we'll gradually build on to create a complete working application.

LBA stands for Location Based Advertising. The idea is that someone with the LBA app on their phone will be alerted of nearby special offers - discount coupons, etc - if they wander within a certain distance of any stores offering the coupons.
