# CodeBot - System Integration

This section covers how to define an application that will integrate with other systems - external/third-party REST APIs, microservices etc.

CodeBot continues its policy of "sensible defaults" throughout. So, for example, if you need to integrate with an external server API that follows established REST conventions, this can be done without writing any code at all. This includes other APIs generated by CodeBot; so you should find that creating an ecosystem of interoperable, CodeBot-generated microservices is pretty straightforward.

If you need to integrate with a non-REST system, or a REST API that deviates from the usual conventions in some way, much of this can be done through configuration and modeling; or, if needed, you can define custom code which handles any edge cases.
