# CodeBot

CodeBot is a cloud-based domain-driven, low-code, full-stack application generator. Feed it a domain model from a modeling tool such as Sparx Enterprise Architect, and CodeBot will create a scalable, secure REST API, along with a MongoDB database schema and a Java client library.

If you feed it a set of UX wireframes as well, CodeBot will also create a complete, fully functioning React web-app, already integrated with the generated REST API.
