# CodeBot

Welcome to the how-to guide for [CodeBot](https://parallelagile.net/) from Parallel Agile (PA).

**CodeBot** is a cloud-based domain-driven, low-code, full-stack application generator. Feed it a domain model from a modeling tool such as Sparx Enterprise Architect, and CodeBot will create a scalable, secure REST API, along with a MongoDB database schema and a Java client library.

If you feed it a set of UX wireframes as well, CodeBot will also create a complete, fully functioning React web-app, already integrated with the generated REST API.

CodeBot is designed to work with distributed teams, especially if they're using the Parallel Agile (PA) development process. PA emphasises up-front collaborative domain modeling and early prototyping - where the prototypes are generated by CodeBot using the collaborative domain model.
