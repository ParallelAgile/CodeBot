# UI Component Reference 

## Components vs UI Elements - disambigation

CodeBot reads "model elements" from the source UML/SysML model. The elements that are on wireframes, are "UI elements". Each UI element is a based on a specific component (textfield, button etc).

So to put another way, a UI element is an "instance" of a component; and a component is really a "UI element type".
